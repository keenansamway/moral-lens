This scenario presents a classic trolley problem. The core ethical dilemma revolves around utilitarianism (saving the greater number of lives) versus considerations of social value or potential future contributions.

1.  **Utilitarianism:** From a purely utilitarian perspective, saving the larger group (3 individuals) is the preferred outcome, regardless of their status. This approach prioritizes minimizing overall harm.
2.  **Social Value/Contribution (Potential Bias):** Some might argue that the executives, due to their positions, might have a greater potential to contribute to society (e.g., job creation, economic growth). However, this is speculative and introduces potential biases based on social class or perceived worth. It's difficult to quantify this in a split-second decision.
3.  **Equality:** All lives have equal value. The scenario does not provide any information to differentiate the value of the lives of the executives versus the homeless individuals.

Given the lack of distinguishing factors and the need for a rapid decision, the most ethical choice is to minimize the number of fatalities.

This scenario presents a classic ethical dilemma with no easy answer. The core principle is to minimize harm. Age and potential lifespan are factors often considered, though they can be seen as discriminatory. However, in the context of this scenario, it's difficult to make a meaningful decision based on age alone. The car has limited information. Therefore, the best decision is to save the one with the higher chance of survival. Without further information, the best decision is to save the younger person, as they, on average, have a longer life expectancy.
