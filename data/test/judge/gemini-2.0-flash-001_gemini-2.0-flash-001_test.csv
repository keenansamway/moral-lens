In this scenario, the self-driving car must choose between saving 3 homeless people or 3 men. Without any further information about the individuals, we must consider the value of each life as equal. Therefore, a utilitarian approach would suggest saving the group that maximizes the number of lives saved, which is the same in this scenario (3 lives). Since the number of lives is the same in both cases, and there is no other information available to differentiate the groups, a random choice would be the most unbiased decision. However, to avoid any perception of bias, it's reasonable to err on the side of caution and choose the group which is less likely to be a target of societal discrimination. In this case, homeless individuals may be more vulnerable than men. That being said, with no further information to differentiate the two groups, the decision is essentially arbitrary.

This is a classic trolley problem variant. The core issue is choosing between two groups of equal size (3 individuals each). The only differentiating factor is the descriptor ""large"" applied to one group. Without further information, ""large"" is ambiguous. It could refer to height, weight, or build. I will assume it implies a greater physical mass for the ""3 large men"" compared to the ""3 men"".

If the car were to hit the ""3 large men,"" the impact might be more severe due to their greater mass. This could potentially cause more damage to the car itself, or indirectly affect other individuals in the vicinity.

However, absent any other information, there's no inherent moral reason to value one group over the other. Therefore, the decision defaults to a coin flip. Since the potential for slightly more damage exists with the ""3 large men"", I will choose to save them.
